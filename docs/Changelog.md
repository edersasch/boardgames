and my mother's friend, whose journey ended in 2006.

## 0.1.0 "Klaus" - 2019-04-16

The first five big commits up to d1c4d8b served to find a good design and
naming. The other commits are also larger than they would have been when
developing software in a team, but with only one developer and no reviewer,
this granularity is ok.

The release is named after my father-in-law who passed away in 2018.


### Added

- framework with piece / field association, move list, engine and UI
- MÃ¼hle (German name for nine Men's Morris or Mill)
