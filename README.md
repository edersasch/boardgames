# Boardgames

A Muehle (Nine men's morris) board, where two players can only act according to
the rules. The Setup mode allows you to enter a board position without having
to play from the beginning. Please note that all rule checking is disabled
during setup, so you can end up with a constellation that is impossible to
reach in a normal game.

Have fun!
