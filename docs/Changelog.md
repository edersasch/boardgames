## Unreleased "Klaus" - 2018-??-??

The first five big commits up to d1c4d8b served to find a good design and
naming. This granularity was ok since I was the only developer and there was no
reviewer.

The release is named after my father-in-law who passed away in 2018.


### Added

* framework with piece / field association, move list, engine and UI
* MÃ¼hle (German name for nine Men's Morris or Mill)
